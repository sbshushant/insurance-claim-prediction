Introduction
Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This project demonstrates how to apply Linear Regression for predicting insurance charges using a dataset of medical insurance costs.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about insurance charges along with various features such as:

Age
Sex
BMI
Number of children
Smoking status
Region
Annual salary
Number of steps
Hospital expenditure
Number of past hospitalizations
Past consultations
Claim amount
Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, we perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better. This includes visualizing the data, checking for missing values, and examining the relationships between different features.

Model Building
We build a Linear Regression model using the scikit-learn library. The process includes:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Training the model on the training data
Making predictions on the test data
Evaluation
We evaluate the model using various metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to determine its performance and accuracy.

Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive guide to implementing Linear Regression for predicting insurance charges. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation in the machine learning pipeline.
